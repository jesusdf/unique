# Unique — Pending Work

This document tracks **outstanding** work, ordered by priority. Completed work
has been archived in [`docs/DONE.md`](DONE.md) (with the detailed why/how of
each fix); `docs/STATUS.md` summarizes the project state at a higher level.

Last reviewed: 2026-07-05. The functional-equivalence and audit-remediation
backlogs are complete and archived in [`docs/DONE.md`](DONE.md) (§18); only
packaging remains.

## Legend

- **P1** — high impact, appears frequently in real schemas
- **P2** — medium impact, common but not blocking
- **P3** — lower impact / niche

## 1. Packaging (P3)

- [ ] **PyPI publication** — deferred until the tool has been used in real
      projects for a few months and proven stable. Not before then.

## Known limitations to keep documented (not bugs)

These have no faithful cross-engine equivalent and are intentionally emitted as
comments/warnings (see `docs/03-unsupported.md`):

- SQL Server system procedures (`sp_addextendedproperty`, `sp_rename`, …).
- SQL*Plus session directives (`SET FEEDBACK`, etc.) and `rem`/`prompt`
  (preserved as comments).
- `%TYPE`/`%ROWTYPE` without `--db-url` (emitted as a carrier type with the
  original preserved in a `/* UNIQUE: … */` comment, plus a warning). The
  restorable-note round-trip is already wired for physical index clauses
  (DONE §17); extending it to `%TYPE` on the DML path is the remaining piece.
